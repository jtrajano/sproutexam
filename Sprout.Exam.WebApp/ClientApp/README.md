Thing to add for production
1. Implement paging of data. Data would become large and implementing paging would improve useability and performance of the application.
2. Base Monthly Salary column should be added in database ( not constant per regular employee type). This could be a part of config maintenance table
3. Base Daily Salary column should be added in database (not constant for contractor employee type). This could be a part of config maintenance table
4. Employee Type also could be a part of config maintenance table.
5. There should be a table for recording the computed salary. An option to record with corresponding month should be available.
6. Admin / Employee roles should be added. Employee for viewing and Admin for editing.
7. Improve aesthetics. Alert prompts and the overall look of the grid.
